# odin-recipes

This project is my submission of the Odin Project's project "Project: Recipes." I demonstrate my current ability with HTML by creating a website containing the basic recipes of three food items.

My web page utilizes HTML elements such as heading, list, paragraph, image, and anchor tags. Anchoring the recipe web pages require organizing the html pages into their own "recipes" folder. Images also have their own "images" folder. Besides the image and anchor tags, the other tags do not require separate folders. Web page complexity could improve with nested list elements.
