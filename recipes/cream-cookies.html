        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An incorporation of cookies and cream. The recipe begins with a classic vanilla-flavored sugar cookie dough. Then, roughly-chopped creme-filled sandwich cookies are mixed in. The power of the mixer breaks up the cookies even more and releases little specks of cookies and cream flavor and color throughout the dough. Next, both semi-sweet chocolate chips and white morsels are folded into this unique cookie dough. This is another way the chocolate and vanilla flavors find their way into every bite, along with some fun texture. </p>
